# Policy for actionlint's features

- actionlint focuses on detecting mistakes. Feature requests and patches for checks that enforces code style or
  some conventions are generally not accepted.
- actionlint tries to keep [the configuration](docs/config.md) as minimal as possible. Feature requests and patches
  for checks that require user configurations are generally not accepted.

These are important to keep actionlint useful and convenient for everyone. I believe that no one wants to create and
maintain a heavy configuration file just for linting CI workflows.

It's helpful to check if a similar patch has been rejected in the past before submitting it.

# Reporting an issue

To report a bug, please submit a new ticket on GitHub. It's helpful to search similar tickets before making it.

https://github.com/matcra587/actionlint/issues/new/choose

Providing a reproducible workflow content is much appreciated. If only a small snippet of workflow is provided or no
input is provided at all, such issue tickets may get lower priority because they are occasionally time consuming to
investigate.

# Sending a patch

Thank you for taking your time to improve this project. To send a patch, please submit a new pull request on GitHub.

https://github.com/matcra587/actionlint/pulls

Before submitting your PR, please ensure the following points:

- Confirm build/tests/lints passed on your branch. How to run them is described in the following sections.
- If you added a new feature, consider to add tests and explain it in [the usage document](docs/usage.md).
- If you added a new public API, consider to add tests and a doc comment for the API.
- If you updated [the checks document](docs/checks.md), ensure to run [the maintenance script](#about-checks-doc).

# Development

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) runs the development tasks defined in [`.mise/tasks/tasks.toml`](./.mise/tasks/tasks.toml).
Use mise 2026.9.7 or later. Run `mise install --locked` to install the pinned Go, Bun, and ShellCheck tools.
Pyflakes must also be on `PATH`. Playground and matcher tasks use Bun.

```sh
mise install --locked hk
mise tasks
```

Lint tasks install the versions of staticcheck and govulncheck pinned in `.mise/tasks/tasks.toml` and recorded in `mise.lock`.
Go and Bun continue to manage project dependencies. Tasks do not use timestamp files to skip tests or lint checks.

## Git hooks

Install [hk](https://hk.jdx.dev/) using the version pinned in `mise.toml`, then enable the repository's hooks:

```sh
mise install hk
# Remove the old hook path if this checkout used .git-hooks.
if [ "$(git config --local --get core.hooksPath)" = .git-hooks ]; then
    git config --local --unset core.hooksPath
fi
mise exec -- hk install --mise
```

The pre-push hook runs `mise run build`, `mise run test`, and `mise run lint` in order, then checks the repository's
workflows with the built actionlint binary. A failure stops subsequent checks.
The hook skips these checks when `CI` is nonempty, matching the previous hook. Builds no longer install hooks automatically.

Run the same checks manually, including in CI, with `mise run check` or `mise exec -- hk check --all`.
Checks use the working tree and do not stage changes; builds may update build output.

## Building

Go 1.27.1 or newer is required. `mise install --locked` installs the pinned development toolchain.

```sh
go build ./cmd/actionlint
./actionlint -h
```

or

```sh
mise run build
```

Builds use the checked-in generated sources. Refresh them explicitly when needed; generation fetches upstream data:

```sh
mise run generate
```

Since actionlint doesn't use any cgo features, setting `CGO_ENABLED=0` environment variable is recommended to avoid troubles
around linking libc. `mise run build` does this by default.

## Testing

Run `mise run security` to check Go code with the pinned govulncheck version. The lint task also runs this check.

Run the following command at the root of this repository.

```sh
go test ./...
```

or

```sh
mise run test
```

To measure the code coverage

```sh
# Generate coverage.html and print the code coverage per functions
mise run coverage
# See the coverage report in a browser (on macOS)
open coverage.html
```

Automated tests are as follows.

- Unit tests are implemented in `*_test.go` files for testing the corresponding APIs. Test data for unit tests are put in
  `testdata/` directory.
- UI tests based on matching to error messages are implemented in `linter_test.go` and all test data are stored in `testdata/`
  directory.
  - `testdata/examples/` contains tests for all examples in ['Checks' document](docs/checks.md). `*.yaml` files are an input
    workflow and `*.out` files are expected error messages.
  - `testdata/ok/` contains 'OK' tests. All workflow files in this directory should cause no errors.
  - `testdata/err/` contains 'Error' tests. Each `*.yaml` files are workflow inputs and corresponding `*.out` files are expected
    error messages (one error per line).
  - `testdata/projects/` contains 'Project' tests. Each directories represent a single project (meaning a repository on GitHub).
    Corresponding `*.out` files are expected error messages. Empty `*.out` file means the test case should cause no errors.
    'Project' test is used for use cases where multiple files are related (reusable workflows, local actions, config files, ...).

## Linting

[staticcheck](https://staticcheck.io/) is used to lint Go sources, and
[govulncheck](https://go.dev/doc/security/vuln/) is used for security checks. Run them alongside `go vet`, Wasm analysis,
and documentation checks with:

```sh
mise run lint
```

## Fuzzing

Fuzz tests use [go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz). Install `go-fuzz` and `go-fuzz-build` in your system.

Since there are multiple fuzzing targets, `-func` argument is necessary. Specify a target which you want to run.

```sh
# Create first corpus
go-fuzz-build ./fuzz

# Run fuzzer
go-fuzz -bin ./actionlint_fuzz-fuzz.zip -func FuzzParse
```

or

```sh
mise run fuzz FuzzParse
```

## Make a new release

The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yaml) runs for stable `vX.Y.Z` tags. It waits for successful CI and security
push runs on the tagged commit, then uses GoReleaser to publish release archives, signed GHCR images for Linux AMD64 and
ARM64, the Homebrew cask in `matcra587/homebrew-tap`, and the Scoop manifest in `matcra587/scoop-bucket`.
Checksums receive a cosign bundle and GitHub artifact attestation. Container images include SBOMs and build provenance.

Configure the `deploy` environment with `APP_CLIENT_ID` and `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` for a GitHub App installed on both packaging
repositories with contents write access. GHCR uses the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no Docker Hub token is needed.
Make the GHCR package public after its first publication so anonymous pulls work.

To release v1.2.3:

1. Complete release preparation on `main`, including the download script's default version until its version selection is
   updated. Ensure CI and security checks pass.
2. Run `mise run release:check`. To validate the full package and image build locally, run `mise run release:snapshot`
   with a Docker Buildx builder supporting Linux AMD64 and ARM64. Snapshot mode does not publish.
3. Run `mise run release:bump 1.2.3` from a clean `main` checkout. The task writes `VERSION`, uses Clover to update
   release references, then commits, tags, and pushes the commit followed by the tag. Clover is pinned by the task.
4. Wait for the release workflow and update the release notes on the [releases page](https://github.com/matcra587/actionlint/releases).
5. Run `mise run changelog` and commit the updated [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). This requires
   [changelog-from-release](https://github.com/rhysd/changelog-from-release).
6. Update the playground with `mise run playground:deploy` if needed.

## How to generate the manual

The manual source is [`man/actionlint.1.md`](./man/actionlint.1.md). The task installs a pinned
[go-md2man](https://github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man) to generate `man/actionlint.1` and uses the project's Goldmark dependency
to generate `man/actionlint.1.html` for the playground. Release archives include the manpage, which the Homebrew cask installs.

```sh
mise run docs:man
```

## How to develop playground

Visit [`playground/README.md`](./playground/README.md).

## How to deploy playground

Run `mise run playground:deploy` from anywhere in the repository. The [mise file task](./.mise/tasks/playground/deploy) runs at the repository root. It does:

1. Ensure to install dependencies and to build `main.wasm`
2. Copy the bundled site from `./playground/dist` to `./playground-dist`
3. Optimize `main.wasm` with `wasm-opt` which is a part of [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) toolchain
4. Switch branch to `gh-pages`
5. Move all files in `./playground-dist` to root of repository and add to repository
6. Make commit for deployment

```sh
# Prepare deployment
mise run playground:deploy
# Check the server started by the script at localhost:1234, then stop it with Ctrl-C
# If it looks good, deploy it
git push
```

Note: `SKIP_BUILD_WASM` preserves the published `main.wasm` instead of replacing it. The local build and tests still run.
Set it only when the Wasm binary and its matching Go runtime do not need to be updated. It is important to avoid bloating a repository size by including a big Wasm binary in a
commit.

```sh
SKIP_BUILD_WASM=true mise run playground:deploy
```

## Maintain auto-generated sources

Some files are generated by scripts in [`scripts/`](./scripts) directory. These files are kept up-to-date by CI workflows.

### Maintain `popular_actions.go`

[`popular_actions.go`](./popular_actions.go) is a data set of metadata of popular actions hosted on GitHub. It is generated
automatically with `go generate`. The command runs [`generate-popular-actions`](./scripts/generate-popular-actions) script.

The script also can detect new major releases of popular actions on GitHub by giving `-d` flag.

The [`generate`](.github/workflows/generate.yaml) CI workflow weekly runs to detect new major releases and update
`popular_actions.go`. Runs can be found [here](https://github.com/matcra587/actionlint/actions/workflows/generate.yaml).

### Maintain `all_webhooks.go`

[`all_webhooks.go`](./all_webhooks.go) is a table all webhooks supported by GitHub Actions to trigger workflows. Note that
not all webhooks are supported by GitHub Actions.

It is generated automatically with `go generate` running [`generate-webhook-events`](./scripts/generate-webhook-events) script.

It fetches [`events-that-trigger-workflows.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/docs/refs/heads/main/content/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows.md),
parses the markdown document, and extracts webhook names and their types. For more details, see
[README.md at the script directory](./scripts/generate-webhook-events/README.md).

Updating `all_webhooks.go` is run weekly on CI by [`generate`](.github/workflows/generate.yaml) workflow.

### Maintain `actionlint-matcher.json`

[`actionlint-matcher.json`](.github/actionlint-matcher.json) is a matcher configuration to extract error annotations from outputs
of `actionlint` command. See [the document](docs/usage.md#problem-matchers) for its usage.

The regular expression is complicated because it can matches to outputs which contain ANSI color escape sequences. So the JSON
file is not modified manually.

It is generated by [`generate-actionlint-matcher`](./scripts/generate-actionlint-matcher) script. See the README.md file for the
usage of the script and how to run the tests for it.

### Maintain `availability.go`

[`availability.go`](./availability.go) is a table for conversion from workflow key (like `jobs.<job_id>.if`) to availability of
contexts and special functions. GitHub Actions limits contexts and functions in certain places. For example:

- limited workflow keys can access `secrets` context
- `jobs.<job_id>.if` and `jobs.<job_id>.steps.if` can use `always()` function.

`availability.go` is generated from [the contexts document](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts.md#context-availability)
using [generate-availability](./scripts/generate-availability) script. It is run through `go generate` in `rule_expression.go`.
See [the readme of the script](./scripts/generate-availability/README.md) for the usage of the script.

Update for `availability.go` is run weekly on CI by [`generate`](.github/workflows/generate.yaml) workflow.

## How to write checks document

The ['Checks' document](./docs/checks.md) is a large document to explain all checks by actionlint.

This document is maintained with [`check-checks`](./scripts/check-checks) script. This script automatically updates
the code blocks after `Output:` and the `Playground` links. This script should be run after modifying the document.

Please see [the readme of the script](./scripts/check-checks/README.md) for the usage and knowing the details of the
document format that this script assumes.
